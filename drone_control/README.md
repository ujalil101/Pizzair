# Pizzair Drone Control Overview

## Control System Overview
Pizzair is powered by a combination of classical control algorithms for drone flight with an imitation-learning based algorithm for obstacle detection and avoidance. It is closest to the [Learning to Fly by Driving](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8264734) paper.
