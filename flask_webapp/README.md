Initial arch diagram illustrating how the web application will communicate with the drone. 

The logistics of deployment are still under consideration. I am undecided between incorporating the Flask application directly into the Jetson Nano, with the web application on localhost, or deploying the web application to a server.

note from Quentin - if you deploy it on the Jetson, I will come to your house and spit on you!
